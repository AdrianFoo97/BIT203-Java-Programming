# BIT203-Java-Programming

## Project for my Java Programming subject during year 2 in college. Object-oriented approach is used to develop this project.

### This program is developed using JAVA for a fitness center.

### To run the fitness app, try the following steps: 
1. Run the fitnessApp.jar in the 'dist' folder (JRE need to be installed)
2. Run the HFGUI.java file in the 'src' folder using Netbeans. 

### The use cases for this program are shown at below:
